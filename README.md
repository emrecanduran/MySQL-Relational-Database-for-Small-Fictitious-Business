# Relational-Database-for-Small-Fictitious-Business

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION 

The goal of the project is to design and create a relational database in MySQL for a small fictitious business of any kind of products and/or services. 

### Things to keep in mind: 
    
    1- Allow your clients to rate the product or service
    
    2- Consider the three normal forms when designing the database 
    
    3- The number of tables of database should not be less than 6 
    
    4- The database needs to be normalized and the integrity guaranteed by using foreign keys
    
    5- Add data into the newly created relational database, with a minimum requirement of inserting 20 rows of transactional data 
    
    6- Generate a list of five business-related questions that a CEO of a fictitious company may be interested in knowing and then writing SQL queries using MySQL 
    to answer those questions. At least three of the five queries should involve the use of joins and grouping. 
    
    7- A description of a fictional business within one page, and an **entity-relationship diagram (ERD)** that depicts the database schema design. The ERD should        
    include visible entity and attribute names.
