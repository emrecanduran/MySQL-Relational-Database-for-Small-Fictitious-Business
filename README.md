# MySQL Relational-Database-for-Small-Fictitious-Business

## PROJECT DISCRIPTION 

Data Management & Storage Course,

The goal of the project is to design and create a relational database in MySQL for a small fictitious business of any kind of products and/or services. 

### Project Essentials: 
    
    1- Allow your clients to rate the product or service
    
    2- Consider the three normal forms when designing the database 
    
    3- The number of tables of database should not be less than 6 
    
    4- The database needs to be normalized and the integrity guaranteed by using foreign keys
    
    5- Add data into the newly created relational database, with a minimum requirement of inserting 20 rows of transactional data 
    
    6- Generate a list of five business-related questions that a CEO of a fictitious company may be interested in knowing and then writing SQL queries using MySQL 
    to answer those questions. At least three of the five queries should involve the use of joins and grouping
    
    7- A description of a fictional business within one page, and an **entity-relationship diagram (ERD)** that depicts the database schema design. The ERD should        
    include visible entity and attribute names
    
    
### What is ERD? 
    
An Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) is a visual representation of entities, attributes, and relationships between them in a database system. It shows how 
different pieces of data in a database are related to each other. 
    
### Why is important? 
    
ERD is important because it provides a clear understanding of the database design, the relationships between entities, and how data flows in the system. It 
helps in identifying the entities and relationships that are needed to be included in the database design and also helps in identifying any potential issues 
with the database schema design. ERD is widely used in database design and is an essential tool for developers, database administrators, and other stakeholders 
involved in the development and maintenance of a database system.
